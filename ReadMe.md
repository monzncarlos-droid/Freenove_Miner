## 🎮 Freenove Miner Usage

### 🌐 Freenove Miner Web Dashboard

On the mining data interface, you can see the device's automatically assigned IP address. Devices connected to the same **Wi-Fi** as the **Freenove Miner** can open the Web Dashboard via this IP address.

> ℹ️ **Tips**:
>
> 1. Data in the Web Dashboard refreshes every **30s**.
>
> 2. Both mobile phones and computers can be used normally.

<img src="./picture/Freenove Miner Dashboard .png" width="80%">

### 🔄 Interface Switching

**Freenove Miner** features four different interfaces:

1. **Mining Data Interface**
2. **Mining Clock Interface**
3. **Global Hashrate Interface**
4. **BTC Price Interface**

#### Button Operations

- **FNK0103**: Short press the `Boot` button on the back to switch.

  > *Note: Since the device devotes most of its computing power to mining, switching may be slightly laggy.*

- **FNK0112**: Tap the **Touch Area** at the top to switch.

#### Touch Screen Operations

- **FNK0103**:
  - Press and hold the **Right half** of the screen: Switch to next interface
  - Press and hold the **Left half** of the screen: Switch to previous interface
- **FNK0112**: Not supported ❌

### ✅ Enable Screen & Serial Debugging

#### WiFi Configuration

In the WiFi configuration interface, you can set this via checkboxes:

*   **Enable Screen**: When checked, the screen is on; when unchecked, the screen is off.
*   **Serial Debugging**: When checked, detailed info is printed to the serial port; when unchecked, only simplified info is printed.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: I am a mining beginner, can I easily configure the Freenove Miner?**

> **A:** Absolutely. Configuring the Freenove Miner requires no professional mining knowledge. We provide detailed tutorials to guide you through the process, and our devices come with the Freenove Miner firmware pre-installed.

**Q2: Why is the time displayed correctly after configuration, but mining won't start?**

> **A:** Correct time display indicates a successful WiFi connection, but a failure to connect to the mining pool. Please troubleshoot in this order:
>
> 1. Unplug and replug the USB data cable (network fluctuations might be the cause).
> 2. Check if your router is an ASUS model. If so, you need to turn off the `AiProtection` feature.

**Q3: Why is my miner's max hashrate only around 350? Is my configuration incorrect?**

> **A:** No. If mining starts, your configuration is correct. The reason is likely an outdated firmware version. Please refer to https://docs.freenove.com/projects/fnk0103/en/latest/fnk0103/codes/Miner/NerdMiner_v2.html#how-to-use to download the latest firmware.

**Q4: How do I know if the Freenove Miner is still running after I turn off the screen?**

> **A:** You can verify the current working status via the Freenove Miner Web Dashboard or a Serial Debug Assistant.

**Q5: I see large fluctuations in the hashrate on the pool management interface. Is it unstable?**

> **A:** No. The mining pool estimates hashrate based on the submitted valid shares, so the data will fluctuate. You should refer to the **24H Average Hashrate** or the **Real-time Screen Hashrate**.

**Q6: I have many devices. How do I distinguish them in the pool management interface?**

> **A:** You can add `.WorkerName` after the configured BTC address.
> Example: `bc1qa5...u4l0gu.WorkerName`
